# About
This repository contains code to train a R-CNN network using the [udacity dataset2](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/annotations#dataset-2). In order to train, some setup is required:
1. Follow the instructions to setup [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn)
2. Put the image files of the dataset into data/MyData/data/Images
3. Generate the annotation files using [data/MyData/preprocess_data.py](https://github.com/bitsauce/py-faster-rcnn/tree/master/data/MyData/preprocess_data.py)

This is the file structure [myimdb.py](https://github.com/bitsauce/py-faster-rcnn/tree/master/lib/datasets/myimdb.py) expects:
```data/
|-- MyData/
    |-- labels.csv (Labels from the dataset)
    |-- data/
        |-- Images/
            |-- *.jpg (Image files)
        |-- Annotations/
            |-- *.csv (Annotation files. Generated by preprocess_data.py
        |-- ImageSets
            |-- train.txt (.txt file with a list of all the images to train with. Generated by preprocess_data.py
models/
|-- mymodels/
    |-- *.pt (Models files)
libs/
|-- datasets/
    |-- myimdb.py (My image database class. Handles image and annotation file processing)```

All the nessesary python files were also updated to Python 3. Some other changes to the python code were required, [see here](https://github.com/deboc/py-faster-rcnn/tree/master/help).
